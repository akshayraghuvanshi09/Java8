Questions on Consumer : 
1. Filter and Process: Given a list of strings, write a program to filter out strings starting with the letter 'A' and then print the remaining strings in uppercase.

2.Custom Consumer: Implement a Consumer that takes a list of integers and prints the square of each integer.

3.Chain Consumers: Create a chain of consumers where each consumer adds a specific string prefix to a list of strings. For example, the first consumer adds "Prefix1" to each string, the second consumer adds "Prefix2", and so on.

4.Conditional Consumer: Write a program to accept a list of integers and print "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd, using a single consumer.

5.Consumer Composition: Given a list of strings, write a program that applies two consumers in sequence: the first one converts each string to uppercase, and the second one appends "Processed" to each string.

6.Parallel Processing: Implement a program that uses parallel streams to apply a consumer to each element of a large list of integers. Ensure thread safety in your implementation.

7.Consumer with Exception Handling: Write a program where a consumer is applied to each element of a list of integers. If any element is negative, throw a custom exception and handle it gracefully.

8.Consumer with Resource Management: Implement a program that reads lines from a file using a BufferedReader and applies a consumer to each line. Ensure proper resource management and exception handling.

9.Nested Consumers: Create a program that applies a consumer to each element of a list of integers. Within the consumer, apply another consumer to print the square of each element.

10.Consumer with State: Write a program where a consumer is applied to a list of strings. The consumer should keep track of the longest string encountered so far and print it after processing all elements.
